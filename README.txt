== Description ==

WP MathJax displays mathematical notation in web browsers, using MathML, LaTeX and ASCIIMath markup on WordPress by using MathJax.js.

WP MathJax is smart enough that loads mathjax.js only when your posts contain mathjax syntax, by detecting the use of shortcode and block. So it will not be loaded on your website everywhere.

If you are not using Guteberg editor and looking for a [Markdown editor](https://github.com/terrylinooo/githuber-md) supporting MathJax, you can also check out my WordPress plugin called the WP Githuber MD, which provides a variety of features not just MathJax, it is worth to try.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/wp-mathjax` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Go to the WP MathJax menu in Settings and set your options.

= Shortcode =

In classic editor, you can use shortcode to render your MathJax syntax. If you are using WordPress version below 5.0, this is the only way you can use.
